In this repository you will find my in-progress work in building a website using some basic HTML and CSS in my e235.

Generally, I am following the Mozilla documentation [Getting Strated on the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started) documentation to do this work. You will likely find some variations in things like folder and file names. 

Feel free to use my work as a reference for own. You can view, copy, and even download this repository and use it as you like. Just remember -- I'm very much learning along side you - so anticipate some inperfection along way!
