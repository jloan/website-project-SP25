In this repository you will find my in-progress work in building a website using some basic HTML and CSS in my e235 course (SP25).

Generally, I am following Mozilla's [Getting Strated on the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started) documentation to do this work. You will likely find some variations in things like folder and file names. When I consult other documentation, if I've found it helpful, I'll try to make a point to document it here. 

The plain text editor I'm learning to use this quarter is [Visual Studio Code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started).

Feel free to use my work as a reference for own. You can view, copy, and even download this repository and use it as you like. Just remember -- I'm very much learning along side you - so anticipate some imperfection and mistakes along the way!

I'm also very much a novice GitHub user, but am looking to learn to use it more in my workflow. If you'd also like to experiment with GitHub in your web building, just let me know. I'm happy to help you get that started.
