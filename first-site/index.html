    <p>Here are a few things about Jeff and I:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We grew up in Daytona Beach, Florida.</li>
        <li>We meet at the school bus top in High School.</li>
        <li>We went to my first "real" concert together (Social Distortion).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I moved away from Florida after college, but everytime I go home to visit, Jeff and I still try to hang out. Jeff has never really been on social media, but he is now on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeffs_restos/?igsh=MXBxbWRyemdpNHh4Nw%3D%3D">Instagram</a> repping he and his pop's autoshop.</p>
